HTML5 Floorplan Editor
======================

A simple floorplan editor written using the HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.  Still
in its initial stages; currently it only displays a floorplan and does not
allow editing it.

Planned features include:
* Single-select and multi-select (rubber band select)
* Resize and move
* Snap to grid
* Snap to object (horizontal and vertical lines, and points)
* Additional shapes (missing spaces, doors, windows)

Possible features include:
* SVG export
* Polylines
* 3D visualization
* Dimension display
